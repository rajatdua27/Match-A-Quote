# Project Title : Match-A-Quote

# Description
Given a quote, find a picture which best matches the quote.

# Abstract
We come across a lot of quotes throughout the day. They are motivating and inspirational but most of them are dull in background on plain text. What if we want to put a nice background behind it? We will find the best suitable picture for the given quote because <br>
"You have to be able to accept failure to get better" <br>
<br>

The above image expresses the emotion inside the quote better than the plain one. So we decided to make the task done!

# Implementation Timeline (Proposed :p)

 - <b> Week 1 : 18-25 March (Image and Quote Collection for DataSet Creation and Analysis) </b>
  We propose to collect free images available on the internet and quotes along with their authors and categorize them acccording to suitable tags which will help in making clusters of similar quotes and removing stop words from the quotes.
 - <b> Week 2 : 26-2 April (Studying Suitable Models for the project) </b>
  As the reverse of this project is already implemented, we propose to find a suitable model to do the required.
  Probably a Neural Network.
 - <b> Week 3 : 3-10 April (Implementation of the chosen model) </b>
  Training the chosen model on suitable dataset
 - <b> Week 4 : 11-18 April (Testing and performance tuning) </b>
  Tuning the hyper parameters of the model, cross-validation, regularization and other techniques to improve the model accuracy 
 - <b> Last Week : 26-30 April (Bug Fixes) </b>
  Beta testing of the model on unseen data and fixing some minor bugs if remains
